## <a href="" target="_blank">Live Demo Preview</a>

## About 
 This application based on pomodoro technique.
 There are six steps in it:

1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).[1]
3. Work on the task until the timer rings.
4. After the timer rings, put a checkmark on a piece of paper.[5]
5. If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 2.
6. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.

## How to run
  `yarn install`
  then
  `npm run start`

## User stories
